# InnovsoltechFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.5.

## Development server

First run "npm install" to install all the libraries.
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

The project calls the interstella back end for innovsoltech to find the shortest distance between planets.
Every Planet has a Vertex ID, for instance: to find the shortest distance between the Earth and Mercury the pop up
wil show 4 input textfield:

A = SelectedVertex
Earth = SelectedVertexName
J = VertexID
Mercury = VertexName

The are also CRUD functions for adding, editing and deleting a planet. To select the shortest path functionality simply 
click P for Path next to the Delete icon and the Response will appear on the top right hand corner in green.


I could not add test cases because of time contraints.
